# Liquidity Providers

Whenever a trade occurs on a Mistral pool, a portion of the trade is automatically collected by the pool. The fee collected is in the same token used for the initial swap, for example, if a trade occurs between KLAY and MSRL, a small amount of KLAY will be collected by the pool. The fees collected are determined based on the assets present in the pool, and you can find more information about the trading fee structure on the Mistral platform.

The fees collected from trading activities are distributed as follows: 50% of the fees collected from trades and flash loan protocols are used to distribute the veMistral users with sKLAY tokens, which are yield-generating tokens. Another 30% of the protocol fees are used to build a diversified DAO-controlled LP treasury, which acts as a solid tailwind for future growth. The remaining 20% of the fees collected are kept by the Mistral team to fund continued development and infrastructure costs.

Additionally, 20% of the revenue generated from boosted pools is also taken by the protocol, and 50% of that is used to buyback and burn the governance token, while the remaining 50% is sent to the treasury for further developments.

The pricing of tokens in a pool is determined by the automated market maker (AMM) logic. For instance, the Weighted Pools use a constant product formula, while Stable Pools use a StableSwap formula.

Mistral also allows for the creation of self-balancing index funds, where liquidity providers collect fees as traders rebalance the trading pools instead of paying a portfolio manager to continuously rebalance the fund, as investors do with an ETF. This works because market actors are incentivized to rebalance the portfolio to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities.
