# veMSTRL

### **Dynamics**

The ve(3,3) mechanism is designed to incentivize swap fee performance instead of total liquidity by combining the effects of different factors. veMSTRL holders determine which liquidity pools receive more emissions and swap fees as a reward, which encourages liquidity providers to compete for generating the highest swap fees. This creates an environment where participants with different goals work towards a common objective: veMSTRL holders vote to concentrate emissions in gauges that generate higher swap fees, while liquidity providers aim to receive the majority of MSTRL emissions by depositing liquidity in these high-incentive gauges. This embodies the essence of ve(3,3).

### The veMSTRL system&#x20;

The veMSTRL(3,3) system provides a mechanism for users to lock their MSTRL tokens for up to 16 weeks in exchange for veMSTRL tokens. As time passes, the amount of veMSTRL emitted decreases linearly, resulting in reduced voting power.

One of the key functions of veMSTRL is its governance role in Mistral. By voting for gauges, veMSTRL holders drive MSTRL emissions and dictate which gauges will receive incentives. Liquidity providers in these highly incentivized gauges receive the emissions directed to the gauge but do not receive swap fees. On the other hand, veMSTRL holders receive all trading fees from the gauge they voted for.

veMSTRL also has the ability to down-vote gauges to prevent spam and boost any number of gauges to receive up to 2.5x more MSTRL rewards by providing liquidity in the boosted gauge. Additionally, protocols can attach bribes to a gauge when requesting votes on the bribe interest gauge.

The veMSTRL(3,3) system incentivizes swap fee performance over total liquidity, fostering a sense of cooperation among participants with different objectives. VeMSTRL holders and liquidity providers work together to maximize swap fees in highly incentivized gauges, while veMSTRL down-voting and bribe markets provide additional tools to control the distribution of MSTRL rewards.
