# Tokenomics

### **Background**

First theorized by Andre Cronje and later implemented in Solidly, the ve(3,3) concept dictates that weekly token emissions are adjusted to a percentage of the circulating supply. ve(3,3) is delivered as a non-fungible token for enhanced capital efficiency.&#x20;

### **Governance**

Mistral employs ve tokenomics which give Mistral & its community an edge. To own veMSTRL, users must lock their 80/20 MSTRL-sKLAY LP token for a period ranging from 1 to 26 weeks. The longer the LP is locked, the bigger the boost to veMSTRL.

veMSTRL is soft-locked, allowing for early withdrawal at a 50% penalty. All the proceeds are distributed to veMSTRL holders.

veMSTRL holders can do the following on Mistral:

* Decide 70% of $MSTRL emissions on liquidity pools
* Earn bribes from voted-on pools
* Earn swap fees from liquidity pools that the user has voted for

Voting epochs are held bi-weekly every second (day) at (time in UTC)
