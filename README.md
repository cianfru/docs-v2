# Welcome to Mistral

## Introduction

Mistral is an innovative decentralized exchange built on the Klaytn blockchain. Mistral allows users to trade assets directly with each other, without the need for intermediaries. This means that users have full control over their assets and can trade them in a secure, trustless, and transparent manner.

One of the key features of Mistral is its automated asset management system. This system uses smart contracts to automatically manage liquidity and pricing for assets on the platform. By optimizing liquidity provision and minimizing slippage, the system helps ensure that users can trade assets quickly and efficiently. Additionally, the system provides efficient price discovery, ensuring that the prices of assets on the platform remain fair and transparent.

To provide liquidity for trading, Mistral uses a unique weighted pool system. This system allows users to deposit assets into pools, which are then used to provide liquidity for trading. The weight of each asset in the pool is determined by a mathematical formula, which ensures that the price of the asset remains stable and that users can trade assets with minimal slippage.

Mistral adopts the ve (3;3) tokenomics system. Designed to incentivise users to participate in governance decisions, while also ensuring that the platform is run in a fair and democratic manner. By locking up their tokens in a vote-escrow contract, users can earn additional voting power, which helps ensure that the platform is managed in the best interests of all users.

Building on the Klaytn blockchain. Klaytn is a high-performance blockchain that is optimized for enterprise use cases. It provides faster transaction times, lower fees, and reliable infrastructure making it an ideal choice for a decentralized exchange.
